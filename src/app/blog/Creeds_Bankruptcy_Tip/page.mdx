Hey, cats, it's Creed Bratton, your ol' Dunder Mifflin phantom.
In '07, Michael's cryin' 'bout debts, and I'm sittin' pretty
with a few grand in play. Every Friday, some guy—William
Charles Schneider—calls, sayin' he owes me money. No clue
who he is, but I transferred him cash back in the day, and
now it's payin' off. That's how Creed rolls.

It's a regular Scranton day. I'm at my desk, sortin' mung
beans, keepin' my fake passports tidy. Michael's flailin',
hollerin' “I declare bankruptcy!” like it's a magic spell.
I lean in, all wise-like. “I remember declarin' bankruptcy…
you just stand up and say it.” Done it a few times myself.
Works 'til the feds catch up.

Now, here's Creed's trick to stayin' flush:

- 1. Find a guy—call him William Charles Schneider.
- 2. Transfer him some cash. Offshore's best, but a P.O.
     box works.
- 3. Wait for his Friday calls, promisin' to pay you back.
- 4. If the bank comes knockin', yell “bankruptcy!” and
     split town.

Back in the '90s, I sent a wad to this William guy after
a shady deal with some “export” folks. Might've been me
in a wig, who knows? Point is, I'm still cashin' checks
with no paper trail. Michael? He's too loud for this game.
I tell him to shout it out, then watch him call lawyers,
makin' a mess. Me? I'm back to my beans, dodgin' HR.

William's still out there, owesin' me. Or maybe I owe him.
Either way, I'm golden. Stay slippery, Scranton.

Peace, love, don't snitch,  
Creed Bratton
