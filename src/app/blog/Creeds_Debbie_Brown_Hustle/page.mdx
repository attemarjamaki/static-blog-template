Hey, cats, it's Creed Bratton, your ol' Dunder Mifflin rogue.
In '07, I drop the ball big time as quality assurance. Paper
goes out for weeks with a watermark that says “WENIS.” Oops.
Corporate's mad, HR's sniffin'. But Creed don't panic—I plan.
I cook up a dame named Debbie Brown, and she saves my hide.

It's a cold Scranton day. I'm at my desk, sproutin' mung
beans, dodgin' emails. Bosses find out 'bout the WENIS paper.
They're yellin', “Creed, you had one job!” I shrug, play
dumb. Then I spin a yarn: Debbie Brown, some gal who worked
on Leap Day, she's the one who messed up. Never seen her,
but she's real as my third passport. They buy it, hook and
sinker. Debbie's “fired” by lunch.

Now the genius part: I start a collection for Debbie's
goin'-away gift. Pass a jar 'round the office—Jim tosses
in a five, Pam's all teary, Dwight's lecturin' 'bout loyalty.
I'm noddin', lookin' sad, but inside I'm countin' the haul.
By end of day, I've got a wad of cash, and guess what? I'm
keepin' it. Debbie don't exist, and Creed's got a new pair
of shades.

This ain't my first rodeo. In the '70s, I pulled a similar
con with a guy named “Rusty” after a bad toner deal. Made
bank, skipped town, grew a mustache. Dunder Mifflin's soft—
they're too busy with their drama to check my story. I'm
back to my desk, beans growin', HR none the wiser. That's
how you turn a screw-up into a payday.

Stay slick, Scranton.

Peace, love, don't snitch,  
Creed Bratton
