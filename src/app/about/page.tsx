            Hi. I&#39;m Creed Bratton. I work in Quality Assurance at Dunder
            Mifflin Scranton. What does that mean? Don&#39;t worry about it.
            It&#39;s complicated and, frankly, above your pay grade.
          </p>
          <p>
            I&#39;ve been at Dunder Mifflin for a long time. Decades, probably.
            People come and go, but I remain. Like mold. Or a ghost. Or that one
            vending machine nobody trusts but still uses anyway. I do good work.
            I think. No one&#39;s fired me yet, so that&#39;s something.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before paper, I was a rock star. I played guitar in a little band
            called The Grass Roots—look it up, it&#39;s real. Toured the
            country, played some tunes, lived the life. Still got the moves. The
            hair&#39;s different now, but the soul? Untouched.
          </p>
          <p>
            I&#39;ve done some things. Seen some stuff. Some of it legal. Some
            of it… best left off the internet. You wouldn&#39;t believe the kind
            of people I&#39;ve met. I once lived with a man who swore he
            invented the microwave. He didn&#39;t, but he made great soup.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nowadays, I mostly hang out in the office, write down my thoughts,
            and try to stay out of HR&#39;s line of sight. People ask me what I
            do here, and I usually just nod and say, “Yes.” Works every time.
          </p>
          <p>
            This blog is where I keep the real Creed Thoughts. Not the
            watered-down stuff they made me censor. These are the raw ones. The
            ones the government doesn&#39;t want you to see. The truth is out
            there, and some of it&#39;s in here.
          </p>
          <p>Keep reading. Or don&#39;t. I&#39;ll know either way.</p>
