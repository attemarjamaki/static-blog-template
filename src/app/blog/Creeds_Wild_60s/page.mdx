Hey, cats, it's Creed Bratton, your ol' pal from Dunder Mifflin.
Folks ask if I'm offended by homosexuality. Nah, man, I'm cool.
In the '60s, I made love to many, many women, often outdoors,
in the mud and the rain, and it's possible a man slipped in.
There'd be no way of knowin'. That's just how it rolled.

Picture '68, somewhere near Santa Fe. I'm crashin' with a
ragtag crew—the Cosmic Bean Posse—in a tent city we built
from old tarps and dreams. Air's thick with weed and freedom.
I'm rockin' a poncho, a beard like a wizard, and a banjo
I traded for a fake Rolex. We dance, sing, pass jugs of cider.

One stormy night, monsoon hits. Mud's up to our ankles, but
I'm vibin'. Me and a gal—Starflower, maybe?—we're slippin'
in the muck, laughin', lovin' under the downpour. Things get
wild, folks join in, and, well, it’s dark, rainy, chaotic.
Coulda been anyone in that pile. No names, no worries, dig?

I wasn't just chasin' love. I ran a hustle sellin' "spices"
outta a beat-up van. Cops got wise, so I ditched it in a
ditch and thumbed it to Oregon. Ended up at a festival in '69,
swappin' beads for a spot near the stage. Saw Joplin wail,
lived on berries for a week. Pure chaos, pure Creed.

Now I'm at Dunder Mifflin, dodgin' HR and sproutin' beans
in my desk. But that '60s spirit? Still in me. Rain hits,
I feel that mud callin'. Get out there, love free, don't ask
names. Life's too short to care.

Peace, love, don't snitch,  
Creed Bratton
