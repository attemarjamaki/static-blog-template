# Static Blog Template

A lightweight, static blog template built with **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **MDX**. Designed for small blogs, this template offers a fast, customizable, and developer-friendly solution for creating static blog pages with markdown-based content.

## Features

- **Next.js**: Leverages static site generation (SSG) for fast performance and SEO.
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe development for better code reliability.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid and responsive styling.
- **MDX**: Write blog posts in Markdown with JSX support for dynamic components.
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly out of the box with Tailwind CSS.
- **Easy Customization**: Modular structure for quick theme and content updates.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
