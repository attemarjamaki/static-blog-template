Hey, cats, it's Creed Bratton, your ol' Dunder Mifflin shadow.
In '08, this new HR chick, Holly, rolls in, sniffin' around
like a bloodhound. Starts askin' me, “Creed, what do you do
here?” Man, I've dodged feds, cults, and tax guys—ain't no
HR lady gonna crack me.

It's a sunny day, Toby's out, and Holly's got this clipboard,
all perky, pokin' into my corner. “Quality assurance,” I say,
cool as a cucumber. “I'm a quality assurance guy… I think.”
She's scribblin', smilin', but I see the gears turnin'. Gotta
throw her off. I mumble somethin' 'bout checkin' paper for
“vibes” and slide a mung bean jar under my desk. Close one.

Truth? I do whatever keeps the lights on and the cops off.
Might've sold some toner to a guy in Jersey that mornin'.
Or was it fake IDs? Point is, I'm the glue holdin' this
place together. Holly don't need to know I've got four
Social Security numbers and a “side office” in the vents.

I lean into the charm—flash that ol' Grass Roots grin. Tell
her I've been here since the '60s, which ain't a lie if you
squint. She laughs, thinks I'm jokin'. Perfect. I toss in a
story 'bout quality-testin' paper in a rainstorm, just to
keep her guessin'. By the time she's done, she's got nothin'
but a page of Creed-isms and no clue what I do.

Now I'm back to my desk, sproutin' beans, watchin' my back.
Holly's nice, but HR's trouble. Gotta keep my tracks covered
'til the next gig. Stay loose, Scranton.

Peace, love, don't snitch,  
Creed Bratton
