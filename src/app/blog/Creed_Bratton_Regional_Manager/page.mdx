Hey, cats, it's Creed Bratton, your ol' Dunder Mifflin guru.
For one wild day, I was regional manager—king of the paper
heap. Thought my '60s cult gigs were peak chaos? Nah, this
topped it, with a silver Porsche and a whole lotta confusion.

It's '07, Michael's off chasin' corporate dreams. I seize
the throne. I cruise in with my silver Porsche, gleamin' like
a UFO. Left it runnin' in the lot—keys in, top down, hummin'.
Parkin's for suckers. I'm the boss, and bosses live free.

I swagger into Michael's office, ready to rule. Then Pam
hits me with this curveball: I gotta find differences in two
pictures, like some kid's game. Says corporate needs to know.
I'm squintin' at these blurry sheets—trees? Boats? Who cares?
I tell her I've got bigger fish to fry, like runnin' this
joint. Corporate can wait. Pam's lookin' at me like I'm nuts.

Next, I call a meetin' with a client—guy named Boboddy. Yeah,
that's what I called him. Bob somethin', too many syllables.
He.s yappin' about paper contracts, I'm noddin', but I'm
thinkin' 'bout my mung bean stash. Might've sold him my
desk. Or fired Jim. Details, man, they slip away.

I blast some old Grass Roots tunes, turn the office into
Creed's den. Desk's piled with fake IDs, chair's spinnin'.
Dwight's bowin', Angela's glarin'. Then corporate calls—
Michael's back, I'm out. One day as king, and my Porsche
is still hummin' when I peel out. Pam's pictures? Never
solved 'em. Let corporate figure it out.

Now I'm back to dodgin' HR, but I tasted power. That silver
ride and me? We're ready for the next coup.

Peace, love, don't snitch,  
Creed Bratton
